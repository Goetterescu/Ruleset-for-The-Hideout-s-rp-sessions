    All legal actions have to be reported to the active chief of the department and later approved. The violation system has not been created, yet - so the active chief can request violation 
    points to be charged on players if needed. Server staff will have the last word in that case. Chiefs can also create their own systems for violation points and fines, this will need a final 
    approval from server staff as well.
