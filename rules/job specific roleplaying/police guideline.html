</li>
<li>
    §5<br>
    Police officers need to keep an <i>realistic radius</i> to the suspect whenever they are collection evidence for an infraction. 
    You can not spot a speeding car from 2 kilometers and around three corners, keep it real.
</li>

    §6<br>
    Communication is key. All actions have to be forwarded to other officers while on duty. Please use <a href="https://policecodes.net">these codes</a>.
