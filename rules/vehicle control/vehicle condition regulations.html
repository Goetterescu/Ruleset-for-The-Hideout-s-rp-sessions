        L1<br>
        Not road safe vehicles are considered a threat and might cause accidents. This means that they can be blamed for any case which involves 
        such vehicles. In order to not be classified as "not road safe", a vehicle has to meet every paragraph of the VCR.

        C1<br>
        Loads are not allowed to be taller as the truck or trailer, whichever is greater.

        <li>
            C2.1<br>
            Ramps and doors of truck/trailer are allowed to be extended and used to hold loads. In that case: 
            the end of the door/ramp plus 2 meters would be the new max. loading area. In short: ramps make part of the loading area.

        C3<br>
        Vehicles (not trailers) are required to be equipped with head and rear lights, as well as brake lights or blinkers. There is no need for blinkers as

    <li>
