<h1>Roleplaying Guideline</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        §1<br>
        This is a roleplaying server, be mature and don't fool around like its a kindergarden.
    </li>
    <li>
        §2<br>
        Keep it real, we appreciate the cruelty of this alternative reality. The game doesn't suck and there are no excuses if you have to 
        walk to the next car shop because your car broke down.
    </li>
    <li>
        §3<br>
        Do not teleport, or node grab too much, you can just reverse your car into the parking spot, if not you should seek a driving instructor.
    </li>
    <li>
        §4<br>
        This saying translated from german: <i>No plaintiff, no judge</i>. Rules can be broken as long as everyone's okay with that.
    </li>
    <li>
        §5<br>
        You are allowed to swear but do not insult someone, out of the roleplaying realms.
    </li>
    <li>
        §6<br>
        Roleplaying ends where reality begins - stop if someone's not feeling like continuing the session. Don't force scenarios on other players.
    </li>
</ul>
