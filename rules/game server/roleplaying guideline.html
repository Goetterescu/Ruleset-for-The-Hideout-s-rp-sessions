<h1>Roleplaying Guideline</h1>



<h2>Terms</h2>
<b>Here are some terms that you'll hear all the time, and what they mean.</b>
<ul>
    <li>
        TP<br>
        Teleportation is when a player uses the map [TAB key] to move to another location. 
        Holding the respawn button pressed and moving your car around falls under TP as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        IC / OOC<br>
        In-character & Out-of-character. These two terms describe if you're acting as your character or outside of the rp-realm.
    </li>
    <li>
        Node Grabbing<br>
        The usage of RoR's tool to grab a node of any object and move it around.
    </li>
    <li>
        PD / FD / MD
        Our three important departments. The police, fire and medical department.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scenes
        Every time something happens that can be played out (like a shopping tour with a friend; a house fire; bar brawl) we call it a scene. These scenes are what 
        moves our event's and make them so fun. Some scenes can be generated by the Staff and will be publicly announced during an event.
    </li>
</ul>



<h2>General Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Additional Rules<br>
        Please keep in mind that this is a second-party event. We are still operating under the flag and the rules of The Hideout!
    </li>
    <li>
        FRP<br>
        Fail role play is the act of failing to play out a scene. This term is very generic and can be split up into multiple sections, which all fall under this rule.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            OOC<br>
            Falsely formatted <a href="chatting guideline.html">OOC-talk</a> is not allowed. Please use () if you want to chat out of character.
        </li>
        <li>
            MCRP<br>
            Missing crash role play describes the act of ignoring a car crash. 
            Please be rational and do anything from at least inspecting the damage, up to playing out to be very injured.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pocket-RP<br>
            Pocket role play is not allowed. If you want to use a very large object, like a ladder, 
            you will have to get it from somewhere logical first (for example the trunk of your car).
        </li>
        <li>
            Forced-RP<br>
            You can not force a scene onto someone. Give players a chance to control the scene as well. For example, play out a heated argument like this:
            <hr><i>
                <b>Player 1:</b> Watch your mouth! *swings with his fist towards you*
                <br>
                <b>Player 2:</b> Ey, what is wrong with you *narrowly ducks away*
            </i><hr>
            Instead of just using something like <i>*Punches you and breaks your nose*</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Node Grabbing & TP<br>
            Players are not allowed to use the node grabber or teleport their car or character for comfort.<br>If you wrecked your car you will have to walk to the 
            repair shop; if you are hooking up a trailer, you will need to do that manually; if you can't reverse a trailer, you will need to learn that skill.<br>
            Note that you can use the node grabber if it's vital for the scene to do so (like when the FD is prying open the door of your car after a wreck).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Scene Voiding<br>
        Staff can void scenes if necessary. This usually happens when a unrealistic or impossible scene has occured. Voiding will be publicly announced in-game and 
        players need to delete everything related to the scene and forget about it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Combat Logging<br>
        Players are not allowed to leave the server during a scene. IRL emergencies are obviously an excpetion. But please let the other players in the scene 
        know that you need to go (OOC-chat), and give them a few moments to sort the situation in-game.
    </li>
    <li>
        Usage of Money<br>
        <i>This can be currently ignored, since we don't have a functional Discord-Bot for this.</i><br>
        Only the currency from our Discord server can be used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Forbidden Items and Jobs<br>
        Only Staff can use police cars and role play for the police.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meta Gaming<br>
        We don't usually monitor this, but we <i>might</i> do so one day.<br>Your character can not read the chat like you are doing, keep that in mind. 
        For example, your character can not know that there's a police officer on the other side of the town.
    </li>
    <li>
        RDM<br>
        The act of attacking a player with no rational background is forbidden.
    </li>
</ul>
