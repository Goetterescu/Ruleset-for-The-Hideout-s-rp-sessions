<h1>Roleplaying Guideline</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        §1<br>
        This is a roleplaying server, be mature, and don't fool around like it's a kindergarten.
    </li>
    <li>
        §2<br>
        Keep it real, we appreciate the cruelty of this alternative reality. 
        There are no excuses when your car breaks down, and you must walk to the next repair shop.
    </li>
    <li>
        §3<br>
        Do not teleport, or node grab too much, you can just reverse your car into the parking spot.
    </li>
    <li>
        §4<br>
        This saying translated from German: <i>No plaintiff, no judge.</i> Rules can be broken as long as everyone's okay with that.
    </li>
    <li>
        §5<br>
        You are allowed to swear but do not insult someone, out of the roleplaying realms.
    </li>
    <li>
        §6<br>
        Roleplaying ends where reality begins - stop if someone's not feeling like continuing the scene. Don't force scenarios on other players.
    </li>
</ul>
